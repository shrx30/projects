# Tuberculosis Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a deep learning-based model for automatic tuberculosis (TB) detection using chest X-ray images. The model is inspired by the research paper *"Ensemble Learning Based Automatic Detection of Tuberculosis in Chest X-ray Images Using Hybrid Feature Descriptors."* Our approach leverages deep learning and ensemble learning techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

## Features
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction
- Incorporates handcrafted features (Gabor filters) along with deep learning features
- Employs ensemble learning for improved accuracy
- Trained and tested on publicly available TB datasets (Montgomery and Shenzhen)
- Achieves high accuracy and AUC compared to existing methods

## Dataset
We used two publicly available datasets:
1. **Montgomery Dataset** - Contains 138 chest X-ray images (80 normal, 58 TB positive)
2. **Shenzhen Dataset** - Contains 662 chest X-ray images (326 normal, 336 TB positive)

Both datasets are provided by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NIH) and are available upon request.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Resized images to fit different CNN architectures
- Applied normalization techniques

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Used pre-trained CNN architectures such as InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, and MobileNet
- Extracted handcrafted features using Gabor filters

#### **Gabor Filter**
The **Gabor filter** is a linear filter used in image processing for edge detection and texture analysis. It is particularly useful for medical image analysis as it mimics the visual perception of the human eye. A Gabor filter is created by multiplying a Gaussian function with a sinusoidal wave, making it sensitive to specific frequencies and orientations. In tuberculosis detection, Gabor filters help extract handcrafted features from chest X-rays, enhancing the ability to distinguish TB-positive cases from normal ones.

### 3. Classification
- Used logistic regression and CNN classifiers
- Applied ensemble learning to combine multiple feature sets

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC)
- Sensitivity and Specificity
